# Reggie 🤴🏻

Reggie is a very simple PHP regular expression (regex) builder.

It aims to eliminate the clutter, and confusion, involved in assembling regexes from multiple sources, to help prevent mistakes and make code easier to understand.  Regexes can be confusing enough: having to also mentally parse multiple, complicated concatenation and interpolation operations, for example, makes things unnecessarily difficult.
