# Reggie 🤴🏻

Reggie is a very simple PHP regular-expression builder.

It aims to eliminate the clutter, and confusion, involved in assembling regular-expressions from multiple sources, to help prevent mistakes and make code easier to understand.  Regular expressions can be confusing enough: having to also mentally parse multiple, complicated concatenation and interpolation operations, for example, makes things unnecessarily difficult.
